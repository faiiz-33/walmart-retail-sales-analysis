Retail Sales Analysis & Power BI Dashboard (Walmart Dataset)

Tools Used: SQL, Power BI, Python
Status: Completed

⸻

Project Overview

This project analyzes 3 years of Walmart retail data to understand sales trends, holiday season effects, department performance, and relationships with key economic indicators (fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment).
Data processing was performed in SQL, exploratory checks in Python, and insights were presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Objectives
	•	Analyze weekly, monthly, and annual sales patterns
	•	Compare holiday vs non-holiday sales performance
	•	Identify top-performing departments and stores
	•	Examine correlations between sales and economic factors
	•	Build a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-downs

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	SQL Workbench – Data exploration, joins, cleaning
	•	Python (Jupyter) – Quick validation checks
	•	Power BI – Dashboard, KPIs, drill-down visuals
	•	GitHub – Documentation & project versioning
