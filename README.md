Retail Sales Analysis & Power BI Dashboard (Walmart Dataset)

Tools Used: SQL, Power BI, Python     
Status: Completed

⸻

Project Overview

This project analyzes 3 years of Walmart retail data to understand sales trends, holiday season effects, department performance, and relationships with key economic indicators (fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment).
Data processing was performed in SQL, exploratory checks in Python, and insights were presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

⸻

Objectives
	•	Analyze weekly, monthly, and annual sales patterns
	•	Compare holiday vs non-holiday sales performance
	•	Identify top-performing departments and stores
	•	Examine correlations between sales and economic factors
	•	Build a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-downs

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	SQL Workbench – Data exploration, cleaning
	•	Python (Jupyter) – Quick validation checks, joins larg tables
	•	Power BI – Dashboard, KPIs, drill-down visuals
	•	GitHub – Documentation & project versioning

SQL Work (Highlights)

Sample tasks performed:
	•	Handling missing values
	•	Creating monthly aggregations
	•	Identifying peak months and years
	•	Holiday vs non-holiday comparison

	•	Base sales remain strong year-round (grocery-driven behavior)  
	•	Store size correlates moderately with higher sales  
	•	Fuel price and CPI show mild downward correlation with sales  
	•	Unemployment trends show no immediate short-term effect
